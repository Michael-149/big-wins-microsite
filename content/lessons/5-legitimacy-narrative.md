## Strategic communication that cuts across political divides enables adoption at scale

Even the strongest evidence can fail to achieve impact if it's framed in ways that trigger ideological resistance. The most successful cases found frames that appealed across the political spectrum.

## Examples of Effective Framing

### "Libertarian Paternalism" (Behavioral Nudges)
This elegant frame appealed to **both** free-market advocates (preserving choice) AND advocates for social change (improving outcomes). By positioning nudges as preserving freedom while helping people make better decisions, Thaler and Sunstein built a broad coalition.

### "Allowances" vs "Rights" (Emissions Trading)
Calling pollution permits "allowances" rather than "rights" reduced ideological friction. The terminology signaled temporary permission rather than permanent entitlement, making the concept more politically palatable.

### "Cost-Effectiveness" (Needle Exchanges)
Rather than leading with harm reduction philosophy, advocates emphasized ROI: $10 million invested annually saves $76 million in treatment costs – a **7.6-fold return**. This economic frame opened doors in conservative jurisdictions.

### "Market Mechanisms" (Emissions Trading)
Framing environmental protection as economically efficient – harnessing markets rather than opposing them – built unusual coalitions between environmentalists and business interests.

### "Innovation Platform" (Unlicensed Spectrum)
Positioning unlicensed spectrum as enabling innovation (rather than as telecom regulation) united tech companies and consumer advocates, creating powerful momentum.

### "Plain-English Metrics" (Social Cost of Carbon, Opportunity Maps)
Making complex research accessible through clear, actionable numbers (SCC, neighborhood opportunity scores) enabled non-experts to engage meaningfully with the evidence.

## Why Framing Matters

Policy adoption isn't just about evidence quality – it's about reducing the political cost of saying "yes." When research findings can be framed in ways that align with multiple value systems, they're more likely to survive political transitions and achieve durable impact.

## The Narrative Challenge

Many researchers resist "spin" or worry that accessible communication waters down their findings. But these cases show that careful framing isn't about distorting evidence – it's about making true findings politically actionable.

## Key Takeaway

Researchers and funders should invest in developing **politically neutral frames** that appeal to multiple constituencies. The way evidence is communicated can be as important as the evidence itself. Be intentional about framing choices and their implications for building broad coalitions.
