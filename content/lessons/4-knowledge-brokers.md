## Ideas rarely travel directly from journals to policy – intermediary institutions bridge the gap

Across all eight case studies, a consistent pattern emerges: research findings don't speak for themselves. They need translators, connectors, and champions who can package complex evidence into forms that decision-makers can actually use.

## Types of Knowledge Brokers

### Convening Organizations
**Examples:** Center for Global Development (AMC), Project 88 (ETS), Yale symposium (Stern Review debate)

These organizations create spaces where researchers, policymakers, and practitioners can engage in sustained dialogue, building shared understanding and trust.

### Scaling Entities
**Examples:** PERTS (growth mindset), BIT/SBST/ideas42 (nudges), Auctionomics (FCC spectrum)

Organizations specifically designed to take research insights and operationalize them at scale, handling the messy work of implementation.

### Government Champions
**Examples:** FCC economists (spectrum), HUD partnerships (MTO), CDC/NIDA (needle exchanges)

Insiders who understand both the research and the policy process, advocating for evidence-based approaches within institutions.

### Think Tanks & Advocacy Groups
**Examples:** Environmental Defense Fund (ETS), Wi-Fi Alliance (unlicensed spectrum)

Organizations that combine research translation with strategic advocacy, building political will for change.

### Credible Messengers
**Examples:** National Academies, GAO, bipartisan coalitions

Trusted institutions that can validate research findings and lower the perceived risk of adoption for policymakers.

## What Brokers Actually Do

Knowledge brokers don't just summarize research – they **package evidence into usable artifacts**:

- Policy memos and model legislation
- Software code and technical specifications
- Toolkits for practitioners (like landlord engagement guides for CMTO)
- Decision-ready numbers (Social Cost of Carbon, Opportunity Maps)
- Implementation playbooks and training materials

## The Translation Gap

Academic publications alone rarely change practice. The format, language, and framing need translation for different audiences. This translation work requires different skills than research itself – and it takes significant time and resources.

## Key Takeaway

Sustainable impact requires identifying (or creating) knowledge brokering capacity. If brokers don't exist for a research area, that significantly increases implementation risk. Funders should either help build brokering capacity or factor its absence into funding decisions.
