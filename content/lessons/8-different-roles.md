## Research plays distinct functions across the pathway from idea to impact

Research isn't a single activity – it takes different forms and serves different purposes at different stages of the innovation-to-impact pipeline. Understanding these stages helps match funding to the type of research support actually needed.

## The Five Stages of Research Impact

### Stage 1: Genesis
**Role:** Generate ideas, challenge assumptions

**Examples:**
- Coase (1959) challenging FCC spectrum allocation assumptions
- Kahneman & Tversky questioning rational choice models
- Early emissions trading theoretical work

**Characteristics:** High-risk, paradigm-challenging work that might not have obvious applications. Often unfunded or supported by basic research grants.

### Stage 2: Proof of Concept / Validation
**Role:** Test if interventions actually work

**Examples:**
- New Haven needle exchange study demonstrating HIV prevention without increasing drug use
- Moving to Opportunity RCT testing neighborhood effects
- Early growth mindset experiments in classrooms

**Characteristics:** Rigorous empirical work, often RCTs or quasi-experiments. Tests core hypothesis but may not address implementation challenges.

### Stage 3: Mechanism
**Role:** Explain *why* it works

**Examples:**
- DeLuca's sociological work uncovering barriers CMTO needed to address
- Growth mindset research on persistence mechanisms
- ETS studies in the 1980s explaining why market approaches succeeded

**Characteristics:** Fills gaps between "it works" and "we understand how/why," often combining qualitative and quantitative methods. Critical for adaptation and troubleshooting.

### Stage 4: Design
**Role:** Optimize implementation for real-world use

**Examples:**
- Milgrom designing specific FCC auction formats
- CMTO developing bundled support packages
- Creating specific nudge interventions (opt-out organ donation, default 401k enrollment)

**Characteristics:** Highly applied work that academic incentives often don't reward. Focuses on making things work in messy reality, not just in principle.

### Stage 5: Scale
**Role:** Adapt to new contexts and populations

**Examples:**
- Regional DICE model variants for different geographies
- CMTO replications in multiple cities with different housing markets
- ETS adaptation studies for different pollutants and countries

**Characteristics:** Implementation research assessing what works where and why. Identifies boundary conditions and enables responsible scaling.

## Why This Matters for Funding

Different stages require:
- **Different timelines:** Genesis might take decades; design iteration might take months
- **Different skills:** Theoretical innovation vs. implementation expertise vs. evaluation methodology
- **Different partnerships:** Stage 1 might be solo; Stage 4 requires deep practitioner engagement
- **Different measures of success:** Citations vs. adoption vs. adaptation

## The Temptation to Fund Only One Stage

Funders often gravitate toward stages they're comfortable with:
- Basic research funders stick to genesis
- Implementation funders want to skip to stage 4-5
- Many funders avoid the "messy middle" of mechanism research and design

But the full pipeline needs support at every stage.

## Key Takeaway

When evaluating research proposals, explicitly identify:
1. Which stage(s) of the pipeline this work addresses
2. Whether earlier stages are sufficiently established
3. If later stages have clear pathways
4. Whether the proposed activities match the stage's needs

The right question isn't "is this good research?" but "is this the right research for this stage, and is this stage ready for this investment?"
