## Research Isn't a Single Activity

The word "research" conceals crucial distinctions. Generating breakthrough concepts requires different skills, timelines, and partnerships than validating those concepts empirically—which differs from understanding mechanisms, optimizing implementation, or adapting approaches to new contexts. These aren't just different tasks—they're different stages in the pathway from idea to transformative impact.

Understanding these stages helps match funding and support to what's actually needed at each point in the pipeline.

## The Five Stages of Research-Driven Impact

Each stage serves distinct functions, requires different capabilities, and faces different barriers:

### Stage 1: Genesis — Generate Ideas, Challenge Assumptions

**Core Function:** Produce conceptual breakthroughs that challenge existing paradigms and open new possibilities.

**Examples:**
- **Ronald Coase (1959):** Challenged FCC spectrum allocation assumptions, proposing property rights and market mechanisms where command-and-control regulation had been unquestioned
- **Kahneman & Tversky (1970s):** Questioned rational choice models, documenting systematic deviations from economic rationality and establishing behavioral economics
- **Early emissions trading theory (1970s):** Proposed market-based environmental protection when regulation meant mandates, not markets

**Characteristics:**
- High-risk work that might not have obvious applications for decades
- Often challenges disciplinary orthodoxy or institutional practice
- May be unfunded or supported only by basic research grants with no application requirements
- Success measured by conceptual novelty and theoretical contribution
- Individual or small-team efforts, limited stakeholder engagement

**Key Challenge:** Academic incentives reward genesis work, but most genesis never translates to impact. The question is which conceptual innovations merit continued investment.

### Stage 2: Proof of Concept — Test If It Actually Works

**Core Function:** Provide rigorous empirical evidence that an intervention or approach produces desired outcomes.

**Examples:**
- **New Haven needle exchange (1988):** Documented HIV prevention without increasing drug use, countering moral objections with evidence
- **Moving to Opportunity (1994-2010):** Large-scale RCT testing whether neighborhood changes improve life outcomes—initially showing mixed results, later revealing massive earnings impacts for young movers
- **Early growth mindset experiments:** Small-scale classroom studies demonstrating that mindset interventions improve academic persistence and achievement

**Characteristics:**
- Rigorous empirical work using RCTs, quasi-experiments, or robust observational designs
- Tests core hypotheses but often in controlled or limited contexts
- May not address implementation challenges or mechanisms
- Success measured by statistical significance, effect sizes, and methodological rigor
- Requires significant resources for data collection and analysis

**Key Challenge:** Proof of concept establishes that something *can* work, not that it *will* work at scale under real-world constraints. Many validated interventions fail when implemented broadly.

### Stage 3: Mechanism — Explain Why It Works

**Core Function:** Uncover the processes and pathways through which interventions produce effects, identifying critical mechanisms and potential failure points.

**Examples:**
- **Stefanie DeLuca's qualitative work:** Revealed why Moving to Opportunity struggled—families faced voucher acceptance deadlines, landlords resisted, families lacked search support. This mechanism research informed CMTO's design, transforming 15% success to 53%
- **Growth mindset mechanism research:** Identified how mindset shapes persistence, effort attribution, and response to failure—understanding that enabled refinement of interventions
- **Emissions trading studies (1980s):** Explained why market approaches succeeded—flexibility enabled cost-effective abatement, trading created price discovery, monitoring ensured compliance

**Characteristics:**
- Combines qualitative and quantitative methods to understand processes
- Fills critical gap between "it works" and "we understand how/why"
- Often reveals barriers, enabling conditions, and context dependencies
- Essential for troubleshooting failures and adapting to new contexts
- May not generate high-prestige publications despite being critical for impact

**Key Challenge:** Academic incentives often undervalue mechanism research—journals prefer novel effects over understanding existing ones. Yet mechanism understanding determines whether interventions scale successfully.

### Stage 4: Design — Optimize for Real-World Implementation

**Core Function:** Transform validated concepts into implementable interventions that function in messy, resource-constrained, politically complex real-world environments.

**Examples:**
- **Milgrom & Wilson FCC auction designs:** Didn't just propose auctions—designed specific mechanisms addressing strategic delay, package bidding, collusion prevention, and default penalties. Each detail determined whether auctions generated billions while allocating spectrum efficiently
- **Creating Moves to Opportunity (CMTO):** Developed bundled support packages—customized search assistance, financial help for deposits, landlord engagement, barrier-specific problem-solving. Design work was the difference between 15% and 53% success
- **Specific nudge interventions:** Opt-out organ donation, default 401(k) enrollment, calorie disclosure formats—each required careful design of choice architecture, timing, framing, and feedback

**Characteristics:**
- Highly applied work that academic incentives rarely reward
- Focuses on making things work under constraints, not just in principle
- Requires deep engagement with practitioners and policymakers
- Iterative process of testing, failing, refining, testing again
- Success measured by adoption and implementation fidelity, not publications

**Key Challenge:** This is often the hardest, highest-impact work—yet generates the least academic recognition. Many PhDs who excel at design leave academia because incentives don't reward their contributions.

### Stage 5: Scale — Adapt to New Contexts and Populations

**Core Function:** Understand what works where and why, enabling responsible scaling across diverse settings while identifying boundary conditions.

**Examples:**
- **Regional DICE model variants:** Adapting global climate-economic models for specific geographies, enabling localized policy analysis
- **CMTO replications across cities:** Implementing in Seattle, King County, Minneapolis—each with different housing markets, voucher programs, and community contexts. Adaptation research identifies which design elements transfer and which require modification
- **Emissions trading system adaptations:** Applying cap-and-trade to different pollutants (SO2, NOx, CO2), different scales (regional, national, international), different institutional contexts (US, EU, China)

**Characteristics:**
- Implementation science assessing transferability and adaptation requirements
- Documents what works where and for whom—identifying heterogeneity in effects
- Prevents overgeneralization and premature scaling failures
- Balances fidelity (maintaining core mechanisms) with adaptation (fitting context)
- Success measured by sustained adoption and maintained effectiveness across contexts

**Key Challenge:** Scaling research is often unfunded—initial funders supported proof-of-concept, implementation funders want immediate deployment, and nobody funds the systematic adaptation work that makes scaling responsible.

## Why These Distinctions Matter for Funding

Different stages demand fundamentally different approaches:

### Timelines Vary Dramatically
- **Genesis:** May take decades of foundational work before applications emerge (behavioral economics: 60+ years)
- **Proof of concept:** Often 5-10 years for rigorous empirical validation
- **Mechanism:** 3-5 years of additional investigation after initial validation
- **Design:** Iterative cycles of months to years, depending on complexity
- **Scale:** Ongoing process as contexts change and adaptations accumulate

### Skills and Expertise Differ
- **Genesis:** Theoretical innovation, disciplinary boundary-crossing, paradigm challenge
- **Proof of concept:** Experimental design, causal identification, statistical rigor
- **Mechanism:** Qualitative research, mixed methods, process tracing
- **Design:** Implementation expertise, stakeholder engagement, systems thinking
- **Scale:** Adaptation frameworks, contextual analysis, dissemination strategy

### Partnership Requirements Evolve
- **Genesis:** Often solo or small teams with minimal stakeholder engagement
- **Proof of concept:** May require research partnerships for access to populations
- **Mechanism:** Benefits from practitioner input to identify real-world barriers
- **Design:** Requires deep co-design with implementers and beneficiaries
- **Scale:** Demands multi-site collaborations and community engagement

### Success Measures Change
- **Genesis:** Citations, theoretical influence, paradigm shifts
- **Proof of concept:** Effect sizes, statistical significance, replication
- **Mechanism:** Explanatory power, practical utility for adaptation
- **Design:** Adoption rates, implementation quality, operational feasibility
- **Scale:** Sustained uptake, maintained effectiveness, responsible adaptation

## The Funding Pipeline Problem

Most funders gravitate toward stages they're comfortable with, creating gaps and bottlenecks:

### Basic Research Funders Stay at Genesis
National Science Foundation, private foundations supporting fundamental research—these funders excel at supporting conceptual innovation. But they rarely fund the later stages that translate ideas into impact. Brilliant concepts languish because nobody supports the transition from genesis to validation and implementation.

### Implementation Funders Want to Skip to Stage 4-5
Foundations focused on immediate social impact often want to fund proven, implementable solutions. They avoid early-stage work, assuming others will fund proof-of-concept and mechanism research. This creates a funding desert for Stages 2-3.

### The "Messy Middle" Gets Neglected
Mechanism research (Stage 3) and design work (Stage 4) are hardest to fund:
- Too applied for basic research funders
- Too risky for implementation funders
- Least rewarded by academic incentives
- Longest timeline uncertainties

Yet these stages often determine whether validated concepts achieve impact. Moving to Opportunity had proof-of-concept for decades—mechanism research and design work transformed it from interesting research to impactful policy.

### Early-Stage Abandonment
Funders supporting proof-of-concept often discontinue funding after initial validation, before mechanism research reveals why things work (or fail). This premature abandonment forfeits the investment—like funding 80% of a bridge and stopping before it reaches the other side.

### Late-Stage Neglect
Scaling receives minimal funding. Initial funders supported proof-of-concept. Implementation funders want immediate deployment. Nobody funds the systematic adaptation research that makes scaling responsible rather than reckless.

## Matching Support to Stage

Effective funding strategies recognize stage-specific needs:

**For Stage 1 (Genesis):**
- Patient capital with no application requirements
- Support for boundary-crossing, paradigm-challenging work
- Accept high failure rates—most genesis never translates
- Evaluate based on conceptual contribution, not applied impact

**For Stage 2 (Proof of Concept):**
- Sufficient resources for rigorous validation
- Long enough timelines for meaningful outcomes (often 5-10 years)
- Expectation of null results—learning what doesn't work has value
- Support for replication and robustness checks

**For Stage 3 (Mechanism):**
- Mixed-methods funding combining qualitative and quantitative work
- Resources for iteration—understanding mechanisms takes multiple studies
- Partnership development with practitioners who understand barriers
- Recognition that mechanism research enables later stages

**For Stage 4 (Design):**
- Support for co-design with implementers and communities
- Flexibility for rapid iteration based on implementation learning
- Non-academic rewards for researchers doing design work
- Resources for creating implementation-ready artifacts (toolkits, training, specifications)

**For Stage 5 (Scale):**
- Multi-site funding enabling systematic adaptation research
- Documentation resources to capture adaptation knowledge
- Long-term support through multiple implementation cycles
- Frameworks for responsible scaling that prevent overgeneralization

## Critical Questions for Funders and Researchers

When evaluating any research proposal, explicitly identify:

**1. Which stage(s) does this work address?**
Don't accept vague "research" framing. Is this genesis, validation, mechanism, design, or scaling? Each requires different support structures.

**2. Are earlier stages sufficiently established?**
Design work without mechanism understanding often fails. Scaling without design optimization spreads ineffective implementations. Genesis needs validation before massive investment in design.

**3. Do later stages have clear pathways?**
Funding proof-of-concept without mechanism research capacity leaves validated findings stranded. Supporting mechanism work without design partnerships means understanding doesn't translate to improved practice.

**4. Do proposed activities match stage needs?**
Academic publication strategies suit genesis and validation—but not design and scaling. Partnership structures appropriate for mechanism research differ from those needed for design. Timeline and evaluation metrics should align with stage requirements.

**5. Is this the right research for this stage?**
Excellence in genesis doesn't predict excellence in design. Methodological rigor in validation differs from implementation skill in scaling. Match researcher strengths to stage requirements.

## The Full Pipeline Imperative

Impact requires supporting the complete pipeline—not just the stages funders find comfortable or that academic incentives reward. The cases demonstrate that gaps at any stage derail transformation:

- Behavioral economics needed 60+ years at Stage 1 before applications emerged—premature demand for impact would have killed it
- Moving to Opportunity had proof-of-concept for decades but needed mechanism research to identify why success rates were low and design work to fix it
- Emissions trading had genesis and validation but required extensive design work to function in real regulatory environments
- Spectrum auctions needed all five stages: genesis (Coase), validation (experimental economics), mechanism (auction theory), design (FCC-specific formats), and scaling (international adoption)

## Key Takeaway

"Research" encompasses distinct activities serving different functions across the idea-to-impact pipeline. Genesis generates conceptual innovations. Proof-of-concept validates that interventions work. Mechanism research explains why they work. Design optimizes implementation. Scaling enables responsible adaptation. Each stage requires different skills, timelines, partnerships, and success measures. Most funders gravitate toward stages they're comfortable with, creating bottlenecks and abandoning promising work between stages. Effective impact strategies support the full pipeline—matching funding structures, evaluation criteria, and researcher incentives to stage-specific needs. The right question isn't "is this good research?" but "is this the right research for this stage, is this stage ready for this investment, and are pathways to subsequent stages viable?" Transformative impact requires sustained support through all five stages, not just the ones that generate prestigious publications or immediate visible progress.
