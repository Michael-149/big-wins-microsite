## Two Distinct Paths to Transformative Impact

Research achieves large-scale societal impact through two fundamentally different patterns. Recognizing these archetypes helps funders and institutions provide appropriate support—because what works for one pathway can undermine the other.

### Archetype A: The Idea-Entrepreneur

**Examples:** Carol Dweck (Growth Mindset), William Nordhaus (DICE Model), Michael Kremer (Advance Market Commitments)

Individual researchers champion a coherent idea over decades, iterating through theory, empirical validation, and institutional implementation. These researchers function as both scientists and entrepreneurs, building evidence while simultaneously constructing the coalitions needed for adoption.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Sustained focus:** Visible commitment to a specific problem spanning 10-30 years
- **Decision-ready artifacts:** They produce tools policymakers can immediately use—social cost of carbon estimates, classroom playbooks, contract templates
- **Strategic coalition building:** Create broad alliances around frameworks that work across ideological divides
- **Patient capital:** Require long-term flexible funding to pivot and iterate as understanding deepens

Carol Dweck spent 40 years developing growth mindset from academic theory to classroom practice. William Nordhaus refined DICE for 32 years before it became the federal government's primary climate-economy tool. These weren't quick wins—they were sustained campaigns.

### Archetype B: Field Accumulation

**Examples:** Syringe Services Programs, Emissions Trading Systems, Behavioral Nudges (in part)

Impact emerges from accumulating evidence across many researchers and institutions. A single "keystone study" often crystallizes decades of prior work, reframing assumptions and triggering cascading adoption. The researchers involved may not personally drive implementation—the field does.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Distributed contribution:** Multiple teams build evidence independently
- **Paradigm-shifting studies:** Particular findings that fundamentally change how people think
- **Self-sustaining diffusion:** Once the paradigm shifts, adoption spreads through normal channels
- **Funding breadth over depth:** Needs diverse portfolio of research approaches, not repeated bets on one PI

Robert Heimer's New Haven needle exchange study didn't invent harm reduction—activists had been working on it for years. But his rigorous evaluation changed the conversation, enabling evidence-based advocacy that overcame political opposition. Emissions trading had similar dynamics: Ronald Coase's 1959 theory, decades of refinement, then EPA's acid rain program proved the concept at scale.

## The Overton Window Challenge

Field accumulation often requires funding ideas currently outside mainstream thinking. In 1959, Coase's proposal to auction radio spectrum seemed absurd to regulators. Early needle exchange advocates faced arrest. Michael Kremer's AMC concept struck many as impractical.

**Critical question for funders:** Which ideas deserve support precisely because they challenge conventional wisdom? Peer review processes naturally favor incremental work within established paradigms. Transformative field accumulation often requires contrarian bets.

## Implications for Support Structures

**For Idea-Entrepreneurs:**
- Long-term, flexible funding allowing pivots
- Support for non-traditional outputs (policy briefs, decision tools)
- Coalition-building resources and convening power
- Patience with timelines measured in decades

**For Field Accumulation:**
- Portfolio approach funding diverse methodologies
- Willingness to support paradigm-challenging work
- Synthesis funding to identify keystone findings
- Rapid-response mechanisms when policy windows open

Both pathways work. But they require different evaluation criteria. Judging field accumulation projects by "PI leadership" misses the point. Expecting idea-entrepreneurs to generate immediately replicable findings ignores how they build momentum.

## Key Takeaway

Different problems require different engagement models. Some challenges need sustained champions who can bridge research and implementation over decades. Others need diverse research portfolios where accumulating evidence eventually shifts paradigms. Both pathways create transformative impact—but mixing up the support structures designed for each undermines success. The art lies in recognizing which archetype a project represents and providing the right scaffolding accordingly.
