## Two Distinct Pathways to Large-Scale Impact

Research achieves societal impact through two fundamentally different patterns, each requiring different types of support and evaluation.

### Archetype A: PI as Idea-Entrepreneur

**Examples:** Carol Dweck (Growth Mindset), William Nordhaus (DICE), Michael Kremer (AMC)

Individual researchers champion a coherent thesis over years, iterating across theory, pilots, and institutional venues. Common attributes include:

- **Grit and persistence:** Visible commitment to a specific problem over decades
- **Decision-ready artifacts:** They produce tools policymakers can actually use (DICE → Social Cost of Carbon; growth mindset playbooks; AMC contract designs)
- **Coalition building:** Create broad alliances around a unifying frame

### Archetype B: Field Accumulation

**Examples:** Needle/Syringe Programs, Emissions Trading, some Behavioral Nudges

Impact emerges from a "keystone study" that reframes prior assumptions and triggers a cascade of replication, policy uptake, and institutionalization. The New Haven needle exchange study is the classic example – a single rigorous study that changed the entire conversation.

## The Overton Window Challenge

Field accumulation often requires funding ideas that are currently outside mainstream thinking. The 1959 Coase paper on FCC spectrum allocation, the original needle exchange proposals, and AMC in 2000 all seemed radical at the time.

**Critical question:** What ideas are important to fund precisely because people think they're outside the Overton window? Peer review processes risk filtering these out if we're not intentional.

## Key Takeaway

Different problems require different engagement models. Idea-entrepreneurs need sustained support for iteration and coalition-building. Field accumulation needs willingness to fund paradigm-challenging research. Both pathways work – but they require different evaluation criteria and support structures.
