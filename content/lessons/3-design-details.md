## Conceptual breakthroughs alone aren't sufficient – implementation design determines real-world success

The difference between an idea that works in theory and one that works in practice often comes down to seemingly minor implementation details. These "details" are actually the core of the intervention.

## Real-World Examples

### FCC Spectrum Auctions
Auction rule minutiae (activity rules, package bidding) changed billions in allocation, revenue, and coverage. Yet these critical design innovations never made it into top-tier academic journals – they were too "applied."

### Moving to Opportunity (CMTO)
The original MTO voucher program had a 15% success rate. CMTO's bundled support – customized search assistance, short-term financial help, intensive support services – increased that to **53%**. The concept was the same; the implementation details made all the difference.

### Advance Market Commitments
Technical design decisions like whether to split funds across firms, set co-payments, and establish price caps shaped outcomes almost as much as the core concept itself.

### Behavioral Nudges
Defaults and frictions move outcomes at scale. The difference between opt-in and opt-out for 401k enrollment isn't a detail – it changes retirement savings for millions.

## The Design Gap in Academia

Traditional academic incentives reward novel concepts, not implementation refinement. Yet the hardest and most impactful work often happens in the design phase: figuring out exactly how to make something work in messy reality.

## Key Takeaway

Funding should extend beyond initial breakthroughs to support the unglamorous but critical work of getting implementation details right. The gap between "proof of concept" and "works at scale" is filled by careful design work that deserves recognition and resources.
