## Partnership-based research is not a necessary condition of putting social science to use

The DICE, ETS, and AMC case studies did not include partnership-based research (in the way we've traditionally defined it: production of new research in partnership with non-academic partners). Nevertheless, all of these case studies had strong elements of **public engagement** – engaging with decisionmakers, doers, and dissenters, often early on in the lifecycle of the work.

Conversely, MTO, Needle Exchange, Nudges, and Growth Mindset all have elements along their path that very clearly included partnership-based research.

## What This Means

A strong plan for stakeholder engagement and evidence of stakeholder demand for the research are critical indicators of potential impact. Success doesn't require formal partnerships in the research process itself, but it does require sustained engagement with the people who will use and benefit from the research.

**The key distinction:** engagement ≠ partnership. You can engage deeply with stakeholders without making them formal co-researchers.

## Key Takeaway

While partnership-based research can be valuable, extensive public engagement with decision-makers and practitioners is what consistently appears across all successful cases. The most impactful research maintains strong connections to real-world needs from the very beginning.
