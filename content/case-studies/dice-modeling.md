# DICE Model: Climate-Economy Policy Modeling

## Overview

The Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model, developed by economist William D. Nordhaus beginning in 1992, pioneered the integration of climate science with economic analysis to guide climate policy decisions. DICE was among the first integrated assessment models (IAMs) to combine neoclassical economic growth frameworks with climate dynamics, providing a quantitative method to weigh the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By translating abstract climate risks into economic terms, the model enabled policymakers to identify economically optimal paths for climate action rather than relying solely on scientific or ethical arguments.

DICE's most significant contribution was introducing the concept of the "social cost of carbon" (SCC)—a monetary value representing the damage caused by each additional ton of CO₂ emitted. This metric became a cornerstone of climate policy analysis worldwide. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and interagency working groups have relied on DICE (alongside two other IAMs) since 2009 to set official SCC values used in cost-benefit analyses of federal climate regulations. This means decisions on power plant standards, vehicle efficiency rules, and other environmental policies now systematically account for avoided climate damages as quantifiable benefits. Today, DICE remains the [most widely used climate-change IAM](https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2024-03/barrage-nordhaus-2024-policies-projections-and-the-social-cost-of-carbon-results-from-the-dice-2023-model.pdf), employed by governments and international bodies globally to evaluate policy trade-offs and plan for climate uncertainties.

## Path from Science to Impact

**Initial Research (1992-1996):** Nordhaus's innovation was methodological—combining climate science (carbon cycle, temperature response) with economics (growth theory, welfare optimization) in a tractable model. The DICE framework addressed a critical policy question: What level of emissions reduction is economically justified given uncertain future damages? This interdisciplinary approach was novel and initially controversial among both economists skeptical of climate modeling and climate scientists wary of economic reductionism.

**Proof of Concept (1996-2007):** Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, Nordhaus continuously refined DICE, engaging with critics and updating based on new data. The regional RICE model extension allowed analysis of differential impacts across countries, informing Kyoto Protocol negotiations. A pivotal moment came in 2006-2007 with the high-profile debate over the UK's Stern Review, which recommended immediate aggressive climate action using a near-zero discount rate. Nordhaus's critique using DICE-2007 highlighted how different ethical assumptions about valuing future welfare dramatically changed policy recommendations. This debate—covered in mainstream media and culminating in a [Yale Symposium](https://ycsg.yale.edu/climate-change/yale-symposium-stern-review)—elevated climate economics to mainstream economic and political discourse. By 2010, a [broad consensus emerged among economists](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stavins/files/aldy_stavins_pricing_carbon_in_jed.pdf) that carbon pricing was essential for climate risk management.

**Critical Inflection Points:**

*Policy Window - Regulatory Mandate:* In 2008, following a court ruling ordering an agency to consider CO₂ reduction benefits in rulemaking, the U.S. government needed a systematic way to value carbon emissions in regulatory analyses. This created demand for exactly what DICE provided: a defensible, peer-reviewed method to quantify climate damages.

*Institutionalization (2009-2010):* The U.S. Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases explicitly used DICE alongside FUND and PAGE models to calculate the official SCC for federal cost-benefit analyses under [Executive Order 12866](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/57.%20Social%20Cost%20of%20Carbon%202021.pdf). This embedded economic modeling directly into regulatory machinery—agencies conducting rulemakings on energy efficiency, vehicle standards, and power plant emissions were now required to quantify avoided climate damages using SCC estimates.

*Sustained Researcher Engagement:* Unlike many academics who publish and move on, Nordhaus remained actively engaged in policy implementation and model refinement for over three decades. He testified before Congress, wrote for policy audiences, continuously updated DICE with new science (2007, 2010, 2023), responded to critiques, and proposed institutional mechanisms like "[climate clubs](https://ycsg.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/nordhaus-climate-clubs.pdf)" to overcome free-rider problems in international climate agreements.

**Scaling Mechanisms:**

Once the U.S. adopted the SCC approach, international diffusion followed. Canada, the U.K., the EU, and other countries introduced [their own carbon cost estimates](https://costofcarbon.org/files/Cost_of_Carbon_Fact_Sheet.pdf) or referenced U.S. numbers. International organizations like the World Bank and IMF cited IAM-based SCC values when advising member countries. Even [private sector companies](https://www.thecgo.org/research/carbon-pricing-in-the-private-sector/) began using internal carbon prices for financial planning, hedging climate risks. The concept spread because it offered a lingua franca—dollar values—that cut across partisan and national divides.

## Current Status

DICE remains the dominant climate-economy model in policy analysis, though with important caveats. The 2023-2024 update by Barrage and Nordhaus significantly increased the estimated SCC (from ~$40 to $66/tCO₂ for 2020) and lowered the economically optimal warming target to ~2°C, reflecting improved understanding of catastrophic risks and climate feedbacks. This update strengthens the economic case for aggressive near-term climate action, finding that delaying mitigation is far costlier than earlier models indicated.

However, DICE faces ongoing critiques. Prominent economists including Robert Pindyck have [argued](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1093/reep/rew012) that while DICE is valuable for illustrating relationships among variables, many key parameters lack empirical grounding, limiting its suitability for precise quantitative policy guidance. Critics note the model can provide [false legitimacy to political decisions](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/07/trump-epa-vastly-underestimating-the-cost-of-carbon-dioxide-pollution-to-society-new-research-finds/) by appearing scientific while embedding contestable ethical assumptions (particularly discount rates).

The Biden administration revived the Interagency Working Group in 2021 and updated the official U.S. SCC to $51/ton (2020 dollars), with plans for further updates using the latest science. The challenge remains translating economic recommendations into political action amid partisan polarization, though the SCC framework at minimum ensures climate damages are systematically considered in regulatory analysis.

## Lessons Exemplified

**PI as Idea-Entrepreneur:** Nordhaus exemplifies the researcher-champion archetype. Over 30+ years, he continuously refined DICE, engaged critics, communicated findings to policy audiences, proposed institutional solutions (climate clubs), and maintained active involvement in implementation debates. His work bridged academic economics and policy practice.

**Sustained Researcher Engagement Beyond Publication:** DICE's policy impact required ongoing researcher involvement in model updates (1992, 1996, 2000, 2007, 2010, 2023), responding to new climate science, engaging in high-profile debates (Stern Review), and working with government agencies on implementation. Nordhaus didn't just publish and move on—he stewarded the framework through decades of refinement.

**Design Details Matter:** The success of DICE hinged on technical design choices: providing open-source code for transparency, creating a tractable model policymakers could actually use (not just academics), and most importantly, producing the SCC metric—a single number that could plug directly into existing cost-benefit analysis frameworks. This "translation" of complex climate-economy dynamics into a usable policy input was essential for adoption.

**Boundary Conditions - When Models Meet Politics:** DICE also illustrates the limits of technical expertise. Despite providing economically rigorous analysis, climate policy remains deeply contentious because it involves ethical judgments (how to value future generations) and distributional conflicts (who bears mitigation costs). Economic models can inform but not determine these inherently political questions. The Trump administration's attempt to dramatically lower the SCC by only counting domestic damages showed how technical tools can be manipulated for political ends.
