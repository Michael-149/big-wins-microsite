# Moving to Opportunity

## Overview

The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment, launched in 1994, tested a deceptively simple question: If you help low-income families move from high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhoods, will their lives improve? The original HUD-funded randomized trial involving 4,600 families in five cities showed mixed results, leading many to conclude neighborhood effects were limited. But in 2015, economists Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, and Lawrence Katz linked MTO participants to administrative tax records, revealing a stunning finding: children who moved to better neighborhoods before age 13 earned 31% more as adults—approximately $302,000 more in lifetime earnings per child.

This discovery transformed housing policy. It demonstrated that neighborhoods profoundly shape children's long-term economic outcomes and that timing matters critically. The research sparked a new wave of "mobility" interventions providing customized housing search assistance to help voucher holders move to high-opportunity areas. The Creating Moves to Opportunity (CMTO) program, piloted in Seattle and King County, proved that intensive support could increase successful moves from 15% to 53%. Today, HUD has funded nine mobility demonstration sites nationwide, adapting these evidence-based strategies. The work has influenced hundreds of millions in federal housing assistance spending and changed how policymakers think about place-based poverty.

The evidence base evolved from disappointing initial results to transformative findings once researchers could track children into adulthood using administrative data, then to actionable interventions addressing barriers families face.

## Path from Science to Impact

**Initial Research (1994-2011):** HUD launched MTO in five cities (Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York) as a randomized controlled trial. Families in high-poverty public housing were randomly assigned to: (1) receive Section 8 vouchers with counseling to move to low-poverty neighborhoods, (2) receive vouchers without restrictions, or (3) control group. Early evaluations (2003, 2011) found improvements in mental health and safety but disappointing economic outcomes—adults didn't earn significantly more. Many researchers concluded neighborhood effects were overstated, and the experiment seemed to confirm that poverty was about people, not places.

**Breakthrough Reanalysis (2015-2016):** Chetty, Hendren, and Katz obtained IRS permission to link MTO participants to tax records, allowing them to track children into adulthood. Their 2016 paper revealed what short-term studies missed: children who moved young (before age 13) had dramatically better outcomes—31% higher earnings, higher college attendance rates, better neighborhoods as adults. Crucially, they found that every additional year of childhood exposure to a better neighborhood improved outcomes, with no effect (or slightly negative effects) for children who moved as teenagers. This timing pattern was highly policy-relevant: it suggested a critical window for intervention.

**Critical Inflection Points:**

*From Research to Actionable Policy:* The 2016 findings created a policy window—suddenly, housing mobility was back on the agenda as an anti-poverty strategy. But the original MTO had a problem: even with vouchers and some counseling, only about 15% of families successfully moved to low-poverty neighborhoods. Most faced barriers: landlords rejecting vouchers, unfamiliarity with better neighborhoods, security deposits, moving costs, and fear of discrimination. If mobility was powerful but rare, the policy challenge became: How do we help more families move?

*Design Details - CMTO Intervention:* Researchers partnered with the Seattle and King County housing authorities to test "Creating Moves to Opportunity" (CMTO)—intensive, customized assistance including: one-on-one housing navigators, short-term financial help (security deposits, application fees), landlord engagement, and tailored information about neighborhoods and schools. The [2024 experimental evaluation](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20200407) showed this package increased successful moves from 15% to 53%—a 3.5x improvement. Crucially, the intervention was cost-effective: the additional services cost about $2,600 per family, while the projected earnings gains for children far exceeded costs.

*Knowledge Brokers - Opportunity Insights:* Chetty founded Opportunity Insights at Harvard, explicitly designed to translate research into policy. The organization created public data tools (Opportunity Atlas) showing economic mobility by neighborhood, partnered directly with cities and housing authorities to implement interventions, and maintained ongoing relationships with HUD and local policymakers. This wasn't traditional academic work—it was active policy entrepreneurship.

**Scaling Mechanisms:**

HUD launched a [Mobility Demonstration program in 2021](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-frm-asst-sec-061121.html), providing competitive grants to nine public housing authorities nationwide to implement CMTO-style interventions. Sites include Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and others. These demonstrations test variations of the model adapted to local contexts while building evidence for what works. Philanthropies including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have funded mobility programs. Several states and cities have incorporated mobility supports into voucher administration.

The diffusion followed a classic evidence-based policy pattern: compelling academic findings → pilot demonstration with implementation partners → rigorous evaluation showing cost-effectiveness → federal funding for scaled replication → adaptation to local contexts.

## Current Status

Housing mobility interventions are now mainstream in policy discussions, though implementation remains uneven. The Biden administration's 2023 budget included significant funding for mobility-related services. HUD continues expanding demonstration sites and encouraging housing authorities to adopt evidence-based mobility practices. However, challenges remain: landlord discrimination against voucher holders (legal in most states), limited housing supply in high-opportunity neighborhoods, and political resistance to economic integration.

Recent research continues refining understanding. Studies examine which neighborhood characteristics matter most (school quality, peer effects, local labor markets), how to identify opportunity areas in real-time as neighborhoods change, and whether supports can be targeted more efficiently. There's growing recognition that moving isn't the only solution—improving conditions in existing neighborhoods (place-based investments) may complement mobility strategies. The field is moving toward hybrid approaches combining housing assistance, place-based investments, and addressing discrimination.

The original MTO demonstration ended, but its scientific legacy thrives through ongoing evaluations of CMTO and related programs, creating a continuous feedback loop between research and practice. This sustained engagement over 30 years—from initial experiment through reanalysis to new interventions—exemplifies how patient, rigorous social science can ultimately reshape policy even when early findings disappoint.

## Lessons Exemplified

**Field Accumulation:** MTO's impact resulted from accumulated evidence over three decades, not a single breakthrough. The original experiment (1994), interim evaluations (2003-2011), long-term reanalysis (2016), subsequent observational studies mapping opportunity nationally (2018), and intervention experiments (2024) built on each other. No single paper transformed policy—it was the weight of converging evidence from multiple methods (RCT, administrative data, observational studies, new experiments).

**Sustained Researcher Engagement Beyond Publication:** Researchers didn't just publish findings and move on. Chetty, Hendren, and Katz maintained active partnerships with HUD, housing authorities, and local governments for over a decade after their 2016 paper. They created Opportunity Insights to institutionalize this engagement, designed implementation tools, and partnered on new experiments. This long-term commitment enabled translating research into operational programs.

**Design Details Matter:** CMTO's success hinged on getting implementation details right—customized one-on-one assistance, financial flexibility for security deposits, proactive landlord engagement, addressing families' specific fears and information gaps. Generic "provide vouchers and counseling" hadn't worked (15% success); tailored intensive support did (53% success). The difference between policy success and failure was in the operational details, not just the concept of mobility.

**Administrative Data Unlocks Insights:** The transformation from disappointing early findings to transformative later findings came from linking experimental data to IRS tax records. This allowed tracking children into adulthood and revealed age-specific effects invisible in short-term surveys. The lesson: investing in data infrastructure enabling long-term follow-up can fundamentally change what we learn from social experiments.

**Addressing Barriers, Not Preferences:** A key finding was that families wanted to move to better neighborhoods but faced practical barriers, not lack of preferences. This shifted the policy frame from "do families value opportunity?" to "how do we remove obstacles?" That reframe unlocked practical interventions with bipartisan appeal (helping families achieve their own goals rather than imposing planner preferences).
